"""Telemetry event models -- strict Pydantic allowlist.

The model classes here ARE the data contract. Anything not declared
on a model cannot be sent. ``extra="forbid"`` means a typo in a field
name raises at construction time rather than silently leaking a value.

Three event types are accepted by the v1 collector schema:

* :class:`ScanCompletedEvent` -- emitted by :class:`SwarmCommander` at
  the end of every scan, regardless of crash status.
* :class:`InstallEvent` -- emitted by the first-run prompt the first
  time a user opts in.
* :class:`ForgetEvent` -- emitted when the user runs
  ``agent-guardian telemetry reset`` or revokes consent; tells the
  server to drop the install_id's row.

The :class:`ProbeFireEvent` is reserved for v1.1 (per-probe attribution
is one of the 6 optional metrics, behind a second toggle).
