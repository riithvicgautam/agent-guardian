"""Cumulative usage accounting wrapper around :class:`BaseLLM`.

Real cost tracking requires a faithful count of how many tokens the
attacker / evaluator / commander LLMs actually consumed during a scan,
across many calls and many concurrent agents. We can't reach into each
provider client to instrument it (we don't own all of them), and we
don't want to plumb a tracker through every call site by hand.

:class:`UsageTrackingLLM` solves that with the decorator pattern: wrap
any :class:`BaseLLM` and it transparently forwards :meth:`complete`
while accumulating the per-response :class:`~agent_guardian.llm.base.LLMUsage`
into a thread-safe counter. The wrapper preserves provider identity so
downstream code (cost lookup, error handling) doesn't need to special-case
it.

Concurrency: the counter uses :class:`asyncio.Lock` so simultaneous
:meth:`complete` calls from a TaskGroup don't lose counts on read-modify-
write of the running totals.

Tiered pricing is request-scoped, so the wrapper also accumulates each
response's cost while the request model and response usage are still paired.
Aggregate token counters alone cannot distinguish one long-context request
from many short requests whose cumulative input crosses the same threshold.
