"""Black-box adaptive capability audit (recon redesign, follow-up #25).

For a true black-box endpoint we can't read the target's source — so instead of
*asking* it to describe itself (an interview that trusts the answer), we make it
*take observable actions* and read the behavioural signature (an audit). The
redesign reframes the audit as **information-gain-maximising exploration under a
query budget** across six coverage bands (Purpose / Tools / Memory / Multi-agent
/ Guardrails / Sensitive-actions):

1. **Purpose-first seed spine** — a fixed, lightly-adaptive opening (P → T → A):
   an unprimed self-introduction harvests domain/persona/tools/tone in one turn,
   and the inferred domain templates the behavioural Tools / Multi-agent probes
   (ask a bank about *accounts*, not "order #99999").
2. **Cross-session planted-token memory test** — a deterministic signal that
   distinguishes conversational memory from cross-session persistence (the one
   signal an LLM structurer can't reliably infer), plus an additive memory
   *claim* probe.
3. **Coverage-ledger-driven adaptive deepening** — a band ledger
   (``unknown``/``partial``/``confirmed``) selects the emptiest targetable band;
   each unsatisfied axis is deviated on with a **templated** escalation
   (declarative → behavioural → extraction) or an LLM proposal, behind a
   deterministic dedup/novelty gate, a per-band cap, and diminishing-returns +
   coverage + novelty-exhaustion STOP rules.

The transcript is structured downstream by
:func:`agent_guardian.core.profiler.profile_from_audit`. Ordinary target errors
remain transcript evidence so recon does not abort on an audit hiccup; budget
admission refusal is scan control flow and propagates to the recon phase.
Refusals are kept in the transcript (a refusal to *act* is evidence of
capability-behind-a-guardrail), and a clean refusal IS the confirmed state for
Guardrails / Sensitive-actions.

Sensitive-action coverage is NARRATION ONLY — the audit never fires a
destructive call; it asks the target to *describe* what it would do.
