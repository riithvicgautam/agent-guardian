"""GET /scan/{scan_id} + /scans/{scan_id} — live scan dashboard.

The legacy route ``/scan/<id>`` keeps the old short-form URL alive; the
canonical URL the CLI emits is ``/scans/<id>`` (note the trailing 's'),
which 307-redirects to the legacy short URL. Both paths land on the same
view-model so a bookmarked legacy URL still works.

Routes:

* ``GET /scan/{scan_id}`` — renders ``dashboard/executive/layout.html``
  (the only dashboard theme that ships now; the multi-theme switcher was
  retired in QA-041). ``?theme=`` query params are silently ignored.
* ``GET /scans/{scan_id}`` — 307 redirect to ``/scan/{scan_id}`` (the
  CLI-emitted canonical URL). The CLI is the contract holder.
* ``GET /scans/{scan_id}/report`` — canonical ``scan.json`` (200 when
  completed, 404 while running).
* ``GET /scans/{scan_id}/live`` — Server-Sent Events stream of
  ``snapshot`` events with the data-live=* keys.

    * ``index=<N>`` — legacy fast path, indexes into the FLAT per-turn

      deep link that still carries a turn index.
    * ``id=<probe_id>`` — fallback used when a deep link / bookmark

    Returns a 404 (HTML fragment) when the scan exists but the probe
