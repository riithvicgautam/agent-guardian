"""FastAPI application factory for the M12 web dashboard.

The dashboard is a small, hand-authored FastAPI app that exposes the
running and historical scan state in a browser. It has no build step,
no CDN, and no extra runtime dependencies beyond what AgentGuardian
already ships.

Boot sequence
-------------

* :func:`create_app` constructs the :class:`FastAPI` instance.
* The route modules in :mod:`agent_guardian.server.routes` are
  imported and their ``router`` objects registered.
* The Jinja2 template environment is configured to read from
  ``server/templates/`` and given two globals -- ``version`` and a tiny
  helper ``url_for`` substitute we use to keep templates portable.
* ``server/static/`` is mounted at ``/static``.
* A :class:`ScanStore` is stashed on ``app.state.scan_store`` so
  route handlers can pick it up via the FastAPI app handle. The
  factory accepts an injected store, which the test-suite uses to
  point the dashboard at a temporary scans directory.
* A process-local :class:`MetricsRegistry` is stashed on
  ``app.state.metrics`` and wired into the scan store so the
  ``/metrics`` exposition reflects real activity. The registry is
  decoupled from the store with a duck-typed sink, so the store
  doesn't import the health module.
* A lifespan handler closes any open ``events.jsonl`` writers on
  uvicorn shutdown so we never leak a file descriptor on a clean exit.
